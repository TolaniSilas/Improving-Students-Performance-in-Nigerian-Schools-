## Improving Students Performance in Nigerian Schools
This project focuses on using data analytics to improve student performance developing a comprehensive data pipeline, predictive models, and actionable insights.

#### - Problem Definition
 
In many Nigerian schools, student performance in key examinations remains subpar, as seen in recent results where a significant percentage of students scored below average in the JAMB UTME. This project seeks to address the underlying causes of poor student performance by collecting and analyzing data on factors that influence academic success. Our goal is to use data to identify at-risk students and provide recommendations for interventions that can improve their exam outcomes.

#### - Data Collection

Since many schools lack a data infrastructure and we could not get real data, we simulated all data used taking into account the realities of Nigerian schools.

Simulated Data Includes: 

1. Survey Data : This data has information on demographic, behavioral, Socio-economic, and social engagement data which allows us to capture non-academic factors influencing performance.
2. Assessment Data:  This data has details of student performance on each subject in their last internal exam.
3. student Data: It contains information of the students (name, number, address...)
4. Subjects Data: Information on the subjects taken in the school
5. Teachers Data: Teachers information.

#### - Exploratory Data Analysis 

In the EDA phase, we explored relationships between different variables to uncover patterns, correlations, and key insights. By performing descriptive statistics and visualizations, we aimed to understand how various factors impact student performance.

Insights gotten from the analysis are :
